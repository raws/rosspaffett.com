    <p class="emphasized">
      I&rsquo;m Ross Paffett. I&rsquo;ve helped build food delivery and mobile payments platforms at
      <a href="https://grubhub.com">Grubhub</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.thelevelup.com">LevelUp</a>)
      since 2012.
    </p>

    <p>
      I lead software teams in Boston, Chicago and New York. In 2023, we&rsquo;ve taken our
      product engineering expertise and applied it to our platform and service reliability
      teams, adding software development rigor to our existing internal platform and tooling. We
      also lead incident response, and maintain LevelUp&rsquo;s legacy enterprise restaurant
      payments product.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Grubhub, I honed my leadership skills with <a href="https://nols.edu">NOLS</a> in New
      Zealand. I apply that experience every day in my personal and professional lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&rsquo;ve contributed to fun open-source projects like
      <a href="http://www.spout.org">Spout</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/hector">Hector</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/leedo/alice">Alice</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/pengwynn/octokit">Octokit</a>. You can see more on
      <a href="https://github.com/raws">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I grew up in Boston, and now live in San Francisco. On weekends, you&rsquo;ll find me in the
      wilderness with my friends, wrenching on my car, or holding a camera in an odd stance. Check
      out some of my photos at <a href="https://500px.com/rosss">500px</a>.
